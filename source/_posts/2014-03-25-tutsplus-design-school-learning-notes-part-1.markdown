Notes from [Tutsplus's courses]( http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/design-school-for-developers--webdesign-13793)

## Planning a Design Project

### Working With Contents
- Contents, real contents!
- Sorting contents
- Contents hierarchy

### Sitemaps
I have some experience on Freemind, also a nice mind map software.

## Researching
- Competitors
- Your customer's industry
- Audience
- Goals
- Relevant design styles
And so on.

## Sketching
Using your pen and paper.
Sketching is not wireframing.
- Mark the key words
- Always in a schematic way
- Ration the information in stages

## Wireframes

### Designing Creative Wireframes
- Creating a digital wireframe is a professional way of nailing down your ideas on the layout and flow of of your web page.
- Keep in mind that the contents is the most important thing in the page, should suitable for the project and its end users.
- Consider the blocks, but don't take it too literally.
- Label your wireframes.

### Consider the flow.
Look at the way that the contents sit on the page and how it flows from one section of contents to another.

### Reponsive design and Wireframes.
tip: add numbers to wireframes to help identity the contents hierarchy when screen becomes smaller, from Sarah Parmenter's Responsive Day Out talk

### Applications and Tools
- Graphics Software(Photoshop, etc.)
- Keynote and Powerpoint
- Balsamiq Mockups


## Designing and Recognizing Colors
It's wise to ensure that you understand your target and how the color affects them.
